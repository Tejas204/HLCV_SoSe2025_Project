### Introduction
Images are affected by various artifacts that distort or degrade their quality. An image can experience distortion due to blur, noise or, low resolution. These artifacts degrade the quality of the image rendering it useless for further applications. We propose a light-weight, hybrid CNN-ViT architecture that helps remove these distortion artifacts from an image, thus making degraded images useful for other high-level computer vision or post-processing tasks.
