Some weights of ViTModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224 and are newly initialized: ['vit.pooler.dense.bias', 'vit.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=VGG16_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`. You can also use `weights=VGG16_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.

/home/hlcv_team041/miniconda3/envs/hlcv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torchvision/transforms/functional.py:1603: UserWarning: The default value of the antialias parameter of all the resizing transforms (Resize(), RandomResizedCrop(), etc.) will change from None to True in v0.17, in order to be consistent across the PIL and Tensor backends. To suppress this warning, directly pass antialias=True (recommended, future default), antialias=None (current default, which means False for Tensors and True for PIL), or antialias=False (only works on Tensors - PIL will still use antialiasing). This also applies if you are using the inference transforms from the models weights: update the call to weights.transforms(antialias=True).
